## App Info
This App is a react based product listing demo using Context API and showcasing the utilization of Props as well.  

This is still loosely created as it is a demo. There is scope for improvements, such as:
1. Taking functions to context folders and creating a separate file to be imported and used as a global source for functions.

2. Instead of CSS, using pre-processors SASS or LESS, and then attaching a single file as compiled css. Bootstrap should be included through dependency for best practices as well.

3. Scripts for Watch and Compilation, development practices.

4. Proxy should be set up in package.json for calling another PORT.
